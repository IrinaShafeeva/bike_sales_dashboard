# Data Cleaning, Interactive Visualization, Dashboarding	

In my learning project, I focused on data cleaning and creating a dashboard for a dataset of 1000 bike owners. I addressed data quality issues and created visualizations to highlight key insights such as demographics, usage patterns, and ownership durations.
